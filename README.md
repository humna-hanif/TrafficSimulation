# TrafficSimulation
For my Object-Oriented Program final, I had a coding challenge in which I had to create a traffic light simulation. 
Initially the ellipse, which represents one traffic light, if changing colors. The user can stop this animation with a 
click of a button. The user is also able to change the color of the ellipse to either red, yellow, or green if and only if
the animation is turned off prior to clicking a color.
